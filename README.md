# critter-catcher

Critter Catcher is a python library that takes an incoming path from a captured photo (from the file system) and passes it to the Firebase example app, (FiendlyPix)[https://github.com/firebase/friendlypix-web].

The library uses (Pyrebase)[https://github.com/thisbejim/Pyrebase] to connect, authenticate, and publish data to Firebase.

Contributions welcome.
